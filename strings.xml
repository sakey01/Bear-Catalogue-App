    <string name="brownbear">Large bears like the brown bear are indigenous to North America and Eurasia. Only its nearest relative, the polar bear, which is marginally larger on average and considerably less variable in size, may match it in size among the carnivorans. Because adult male brown bears are larger and more compactly formed than females, the species is sexually dimorphic.</string>
    <string name="polarbear">Large bears like the polar bear are indigenous to the Arctic. It can interbreed with the brown bear, with which it shares a close relationship. With adult males weighing between 300 and 800 kg, the polar bear is the largest terrestrial carnivore and bear species still in existence. Because adult females are significantly smaller than males, the species exhibits sexual dimorphism. </string>

    <string name="slothbear">The sloth bear is a unique bear species found mostly in India and Sri Lanka. Unlike other bears, it has a shaggy black coat, a long snout, and a white "U" or "Y"-shaped mark on its chest. These bears are known for their love of insects, especially termites and ants, which they suck up through their lips like a vacuum. They are excellent climbers and often sleep in trees to stay safe from predators like tigers</string>
